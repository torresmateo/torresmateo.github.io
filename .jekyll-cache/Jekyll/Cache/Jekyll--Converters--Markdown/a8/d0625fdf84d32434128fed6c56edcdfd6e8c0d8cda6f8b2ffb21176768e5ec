I"<p>It‚Äôs been a while since I updated this thingy‚Ä¶ Hello!</p>

<p>Tonight it‚Äôs all about my first month in the UK. For a brief summary: I‚Äôm starting a PhD in Computer Science (Bioinformatics) at Royal Holloway, University of London. It will take four years counting from September 2015 (yes, I arrived a little bit late, more details below).</p>

<p>#I‚Äôm going on an adventure!</p>

<p>Leaving home is always exiting and frankly quite scary, especially since I never really spent long periods of time away from home. I was especially aware of everything thanks to both my mother and my sister (who are the ones that usually travel a lot in my family) who literally packed a lot of stuff in the suitcases that I thought were unnecessary but I was (obviously) utterly wrong.</p>

<p>Arriving here was quite a challenge, even after I had accepted the offer from Royal Holloway. The visa process takes a really long time and I had to go to Buenos Aires just to provide the required documents, and after that they process everything in Bogot√°! (I hope they have a very good reason to spend so much in posting documents around instead of hiring some people to process the documents locally, but that‚Äôs not the point today). Nevertheless, I made it!</p>

<p>#I can cook after all</p>

<p>One of the things I am proud of is the fact that I can actually cook! (And this means more than assemble some ingredients into a sandwich or a pizza at best). But behold!</p>

This is a fugazza I made on the second weekend (and I realised I didn‚Äôt have a rolling pin!). It tasted very good!</p>

This is.. a ‚Ä¶ tuna thing! (or tuna cake, or tuna bread). I tried in the first weekend here when I went to my supervisor‚Äôs house for a party. We were all so delighted by this that we asked for the recipe and I made it! (It wasn‚Äôt as good as the original one, but it tasted good nonetheless).</p>

<p>#The Place</p>

<p>I live in Egham, just outside London. It is far greener than I expected and walking is easier than in Asunci√≥n (because weather is not inhumanly hot). Here are 4 pictures of my first walk around Egham and Englefield Green (the town next to Egham).</p>

<p>#Royal Holloway, University of London</p>

<p>It is beyond my ability to find the right words to describe the University, so‚Ä¶ pictures!

<p>#The Lab</p>

<p>I‚Äôm currently in the Computer Science Department at Royal Holloway, working in <a href="http://www.paccanarolab.org">PaccanaroLab</a> (run by Alberto Paccanaro, my supervisor).</p>

<p>People here is amazing, right now we are mostly from Paraguay (check the ‚Äúpeople‚Äù section in the website) and I feel very good working with everybody! Also, I get to work in the same place as the creator of the amazing tool <a href="http://igraph.org">igraph</a> used to work, which is AWESOME!!</p>
