It's been a while since I updated this thingy... Hello!

Tonight it's all about my first month in the UK. For a brief summary: I'm starting a PhD in Computer Science (Bioinformatics) at Royal Holloway, University of London. It will take four years counting from September 2015 (yes, I arrived a little bit late, more details below).

#I'm going on an adventure!

Leaving home is always exiting and frankly quite scary, especially since I never really spent long periods of time away from home. I was especially aware of everything thanks to both my mother and my sister (who are the ones that usually travel a lot in my family) who literally packed a lot of stuff in the suitcases that I thought were unnecessary but I was (obviously) utterly wrong.

Arriving here was quite a challenge, even after I had accepted the offer from Royal Holloway. The visa process takes a really long time and I had to go to Buenos Aires just to provide the required documents, and after that they process everything in Bogotá! (I hope they have a very good reason to spend so much in posting documents around instead of hiring some people to process the documents locally, but that's not the point today). Nevertheless, I made it! 

#I can cook after all

One of the things I am proud of is the fact that I can actually cook! (And this means more than assemble some ingredients into a sandwich or a pizza at best). But behold!

This is a fugazza I made on the second weekend (and I realised I didn't have a rolling pin!). It tasted very good! 

![][tuna-thing]
This is.. a ... tuna thing! (or tuna cake, or tuna bread). I tried in the first weekend here when I went to my supervisor's house for a party. We were all so delighted by this that we asked for the recipe and I made it! (It wasn't as good as the original one, but it tasted good nonetheless).

#The Place

I live in Egham, just outside London. It is far greener than I expected and walking is easier than in Asunción (because weather is not inhumanly hot). Here are 4 pictures of my first walk around Egham and Englefield Green (the town next to Egham).

#Royal Holloway, University of London

It is beyond my ability to find the right words to describe the University, so... pictures!

#The Lab

I'm currently in the Computer Science Department at Royal Holloway, working in [PaccanaroLab](http://www.paccanarolab.org) (run by Alberto Paccanaro, my supervisor).

People here is amazing, right now we are mostly from Paraguay (check the "people" section in the website) and I feel very good working with everybody! Also, I get to work in the same place as the creator of the amazing tool [igraph](http://igraph.org) used to work, which is AWESOME!!
