                                <title>Backgammon Madness</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence is the heart of a Player vs. PC game, and there are a lot of options to have a program &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt;. For instance,
if you have to make a game like &lt;a href=&quot;/evolution/gaming/dev/2014/01/10/ui-design.html&quot;&gt;Bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, the obvious choice is
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning&quot;&gt;Alpha-Beta pruning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assignment Fer and I had was &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backgammon&quot;&gt;Backgammon&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s a board game with checkers and dices. The
main goal is to move your checkers from your &amp;quot;house&amp;quot; to the opponent&amp;#39;s. In your turn you throw a pair of dices, and move the checkers forward.
If you&amp;#39;ve got the same result in both dices, you earn a double turn, moving four times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s actually a boring game, compared to chess, but Fer and I learned how to play, and even watched YouTube videos of the world championship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When this assignment was given, one of the requirements was to use alpha-beta pruning for the AI. It didn&amp;#39;t feel right to me, because adding
dices to the mix leaves you with a lot of randomness. Of course you can modify alpha-beta to deal with the randomness, but as I&amp;#39;ve said above,
there are A LOT of options, and it&amp;#39;s part of the art of problem solving to pick the right tool for the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In class, I asked our teacher about this, and he didn&amp;#39;t answer my question. I stayed after class to him again, and we had an argument about the
right algorithm to use for the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The implementation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graphically, it&amp;#39;s the same as &lt;a href=&quot;/evolution/gaming/dev/2014/01/10/ui-design.html&quot;&gt;Bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. Even the mouse handler is 90% taken from our previous
implementation, we used color masks and sprites. &lt;a href=&quot;http://alleg.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;Allegro&lt;/a&gt; was also the library we used again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference was AI. We had to learn some useful strategies for backgammon. The game has two logical stages. In the first stage, the opponent
can block your checkers, and this means a lot of computation towards avoiding that, and focusing on desirable board configurations. In the
second stage it&amp;#39;s simply a &amp;quot;race&amp;quot;, the first player to reach the opponent&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; wins the game. We implemented a weight based heuristic for
both stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first heuristic was focused in achieving good board configurations, we had points for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distance to the opponent&amp;#39;s home (low priority)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid blocked checkers (medium priority)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Block opponent&amp;#39;s checkers (medium priority)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Occupy six adjacent columns (high priority)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were other aspects, but these four are the most important. The last one was added after watching a lot of (boring) backgammon games online.
Professional players seemed to aim for a particular board configuration. When you have two or more checkers in the same column, the opponent can&amp;#39;t
block your checkers in that column, so having six consecutive columns occupied means you own a &amp;quot;wall&amp;quot; of columns that the other player can&amp;#39;t
pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second stage has the following priorities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distance to the opponent&amp;#39;s home (high priority)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything else (no priority)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, it&amp;#39;s focused on reaching the opponent&amp;#39;s home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The tournament&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of this implementation was to make every team challenge other&amp;#39;s programs. It was fun, at first we won because most of our classmates&amp;#39;
programs weren&amp;#39;t finished. We ended with 3 complete games (best of 3), the first two we won 2-0, and the last one (the final game of the tournament)
was our program against Rafael Arias Michel and Daniel Ruffinelli&amp;#39;s implementation, I&amp;#39;ll refer to them as &lt;em&gt;Rafa&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ruffo&lt;/em&gt; from now on unless they
ask me not to, in which case I&amp;#39;ll probably keep calling them &lt;em&gt;Rafa&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ruffo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They had a nice implementation in GTK, and if I remember correctly they had implemented Alpha-Beta Pruning. Our program won the first match, the second
one we lost! By that moment we had an audience (about 6 classmates who were interested enough to stay and watch a bunch of nerds cheering for their
own implementation of a complete boring board game). The last game was interesting, both programs made mistakes, specially at the end. We could not tell
who had the advantage until the very end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily we won :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Video and Code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, but not least, here&amp;#39;s the video of me playing (and winning!) against my own implementation. The interface this time isn&amp;#39;t as elaborated as in
Bacteria, but the main reasons were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The objective was not to make a playable PC vs Player game, we did it for completeness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backgammon is boring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We focused on the PC vs PC tournament instead of Interface and/or Design, I think it looks OK though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backgammon is boring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did I mention how boring Backgammon is?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING:&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#39;s about 4 minutes of myself playing a boring game :)&lt;/p&gt;

                                <link>http://torresmateo.github.io//evolution/gaming/dev/2014/03/19/backgammon.html</link>

                                <title>Bacteria, Part 2: Gameplay, Drag &amp; Drop and other Stuff</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the second part of the Bacteria development, I&amp;#39;ll focus in gameplay, and the technique we used for implementing drag and drop
with Allegro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Gameplay&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I&amp;#39;ll give a little introduction of what gameplay is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gameplay is the specific way in which players interact with a game, and in particular with video games. Gameplay is the pattern defined 
through the game rules, connection between player and the game, challenges and overcoming them, plot and player&amp;#39;s connection with it. 
Video game gameplay is distinct from graphics, and audio elements.
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot;&gt;&amp;#8213;Random Dude in Wikipedia&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That should be clear enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our game, we wanted the player to focus in the strategic part of the game, and not to deal with an uncomfortable way of interacting
with objects on the screen. In our previous games the player had to learn a bunch of &amp;quot;complicated&amp;quot; controls to do things, and it wasn&amp;#39;t
fun to play that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Drag &amp;amp; Drop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Bacteria is a board game, the intuitive way to interact with it is obviously the mouse. Here&amp;#39;s a list of the things you can do with
any mouse:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move pointer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-Click.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty limited. I didn&amp;#39;t include &lt;em&gt;scroll&lt;/em&gt; in that list because (sadly) not all mice have a scroll wheel. So, handling the mouse is 
not as simple as it can appear at first sight... aaaand right-clicking sucks in a board game... so... here&amp;#39;s our new list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move pointer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait!! If you think about it, there are special things about the click event, and it&amp;#39;s all about timing. In every mouse based interface
you have more options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Double-click:&lt;/strong&gt; Click two times, fast. It&amp;#39;s like clicking, but if almost every time a single-click is &lt;code&gt;select&lt;/code&gt;, double click is &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; or, 
in a more general way: &lt;code&gt;interact&lt;/code&gt; with the double-clicked element.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drag-and-Drop:&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#39;s done by pressing on the element, moving the mouse while still pressing the mouse button, and then releasing the button
in another area in the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These options are called &lt;em&gt;gestures&lt;/em&gt;. We were interested in &lt;em&gt;Drag-and-Drop&lt;/em&gt;, because it&amp;#39;s the simplest way to &amp;quot;move&amp;quot; one object over the scene.
The basic idea is click and hold one of the little bacteria, and somehow give the player the feeling that s/he is &amp;quot;holding&amp;quot; the object as long
as the mouse button is pressed. We implemented this feature by doing the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On mouse press:&lt;/strong&gt; Quickly swap the bacteria with a &amp;quot;phantom&amp;quot; version, useful to know the original position in the board. Also, replace the
mouse pointer, our choice was the same pointer with a bacteria attached to it, so wherever the player moved the mouse, the bacteria seemed
to be glued to the pointer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On mouse release:&lt;/strong&gt; Swap the pointer image to the original (the one without the bacteria attached). If the player released in a valid cell, 
the original cell now looks like an empty cell, and the new cell now hold a bacteria. If the player released in any other place, the phantom
version returns to be the normal bacteria.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It worked like a charm!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s an image showing the empty cell, the &amp;quot;phantom&amp;quot; bacteria , the &amp;quot;infected&amp;quot; cell, and both pointers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://torresmateo.github.io/images/bacteria-part-2/blue_bacteria.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Blue Bacteria&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Artificial Intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some words about the intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, we knew absolutely NOTHING about game theory at the time, and I think we did pretty well taking that into account. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our implementation was a tree-like decision structure. We started by assuming the enemy played the best he could, and the AI moves acted accordingly.
It&amp;#39;s pretty clever after reading the code almost 4 years later =). It&amp;#39;s not very hard to beat the computer with this AI, but not ultra-easy though, 
it takes to think at least two moves ahead to win. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Finally&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well... I wrote a LOT about Bacteria, and after reading it myself I decided it was long and boring, so I erased all of it and instead made a 
video of myself showing what I think are the best parts of this game:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Menus... they look AWESOME!!.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Board Editor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instruction Pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not a long video, and I lose (in my defense, the purpose of this wasn&amp;#39;t for me to win, but to show the features).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/H9hrEwQNlbw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;To be continued...&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next post is not about Bacteria. It&amp;#39;s about Backgammon, but only the AI part, since all the rest is pretty similar to Bacteria, the interesting
part is the intelligence. I plan to make another video for that post, since it&amp;#39;s much easier for me to show the features that way, and maybe
it&amp;#39;s a better experience to you to actually see the interactivity and other things that can&amp;#39;t be seen properly in still images.&lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>Bacteria, Part 1: UI Design</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the projects I feel proud about is called Bacteria (a modified version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://hexxagon.com/&quot;&gt;Hexxagon&lt;/a&gt;). It&amp;#39;s the first
serious game challenge that we (Fer and I) had in college. This post is about the first set of problems we had to deal with in
the proccess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project covers a lot of things, and I decided to split it in at least two posts, since it&amp;#39;s taking me longer
than expected. This post is very rich in images for those who like to watch stuff rather than read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING: this post contains some technical words.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The First BIG (and scary) Project&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, this project was like a titan for us at the beginning. We had absolutely no clue of what to do, nor where to start.
There were just too many thing to take into account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hexxagon is a board game. The board is hexagonal (what??... &lt;em&gt;first challenge&lt;/em&gt;). The goal is to own more cells than the opponent.
To make it fun, it &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; a good &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface&quot;&gt;GUI&lt;/a&gt;, and a LOT of interactive features. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make it easy, here is one possible board, each hexagon is a cell:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://torresmateo.github.io/images/bacteria/hexboard.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;possible board&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Same as Hexxagon, two types of moves, you can &lt;em&gt;multiply&lt;/em&gt; to a cell next to yours, or you can &lt;em&gt;jump&lt;/em&gt;  over one cell
in an hexagonal board.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The winner is the player who owns more cells when the board has no free cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For our particular implementation, we had to add this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A hint about where you can jump, or multiply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A board editor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiplayer Feature based on a given XML Protocol (Maybe I&amp;#39;ll describe the protocol in the next post).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sound.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, at first sight, it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like a LOT, but we wanted to make a great game out of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rules and Logic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programming the game logic wasn&amp;#39;t really hard. In the first day we had a working console implementation and we could &amp;quot;play&amp;quot; the
game having absolutely no fun because we had to write every command to make a simple move, something like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;multiply cell A8 to A9
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the output was really awful, a lot of debug using &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; and also tons of (apparently) meaningless garbage. But we were enjoying
the development proccess like a child who gets a Nintendo 64 on Christmas! When it was clear that the logic was done, we were ready
for te REAL FUN!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;GUI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember the Sudoku project we made with WinAPI? Well, we considered that UI awful. We wanted to make a game that could make
people say &amp;quot;ooooohhhhh&amp;quot;. So we started searching for 2D game engines and libraries, and there were a few interesting options.
After reading about SDL, GTK and other options we ended up using &lt;a href=&quot;http://alleg.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;Allegro&lt;/a&gt;, a Game Programming
Library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first challenge was &amp;quot;how the hell are we going to make this pretty&amp;quot;. I started making drafts in paper and we would discuss with Fer
the good and the bad of every menu and how it should work. It was clear we needed a cell that worked like a brick, so we
can build many different boards (with holes, or two separate &amp;quot;islands&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This image shows a possible board, the first image is our board editor, and the second is the game view with the statistics.
I still look at this and can&amp;#39;t help a little smile of satisfaction and pride :&amp;#39;D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://torresmateo.github.io/images/bacteria/board_editor.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Our Board Editor&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://torresmateo.github.io/images/bacteria/game_view.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Game View&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the cell borders in the game view. To draw this borders we had to step into every cell and check for adjacent objects!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another Challenge was menus. Since Allegro gives you &amp;quot;per-pixel&amp;quot; control, we wanted to take advantage of that and make buttons
with nice shapes, effects and colors. We came up with a technique using color masks to detect when a user hovers or clicks inside
a button or anything we wanted to be interactive (it turned out it was a well-known technique, but back then we feel awed by our
own witts). Here&amp;#39;s an Image of the mask, and the menu with one of the buttons highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://torresmateo.github.io/images/bacteria/ingame_shape.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Mask&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://torresmateo.github.io/images/bacteria/button_highlight.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Button Highlighted&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note how the mask color matches the shape of the blue bacteria. If the user clicked on our GUI, we asked for the pointer position,
and looked what color was clicked in the mask, easy right? Here&amp;#39;s a visual explanation, the red line is intended to show how
mask and design share positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://torresmateo.github.io/images/bacteria/explanation.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Mask and GUI Overlay&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;To be continued..&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all for the moment, I have a draft of the second part, it&amp;#39;s about how we faced gameplay, drag and drop, networking, and
artificial intelligence. Give me feedback if you want me to explain a little further any aspect, maybe with code explanation or
in a tutorial-like format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand last, but not least... here&amp;#39;s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/torresmateo/Bacteria&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                <description>&lt;p&gt;When you start coding, your entire world can change in little time. Or at least that happened to me. I can only describe it like being in
opposite sides of a thick wall:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On one side all you can see is the result: programs, websites, Operating Systems, yadda, yadda, yadda. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the other side though, you can see the clockwork of all that, and by seeing it, you can &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; what&amp;#39;s going on! You begin to appreciate the quality of 
the structures, the speed, the design, and the challenge that it must have demanded from the developers. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s how I think the cooks probably can appreciate food better than most of us who can barely make a sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Baby Steps&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Gooey??&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started coding, I did a lot of basic programs, and that felt great. But the first one I really enjoyed was this little project in college. We had to write
a program that let the player:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play a game of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku&quot;&gt;Sudoku&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resume a previous game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show the mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep a Score.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty basic, thinking of it now, but back then was a serious challenge. My friend (and classmate) Fernando Minardi (who I will call &lt;em&gt;Fer&lt;/em&gt; from here) was my partner in 
the project, and we decided to give the player a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface&quot;&gt;GUI&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(graphical user interface)&lt;/em&gt; (it wasn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; for 
the evaluation, but we wanted to &amp;quot;get our hands dirty&amp;quot;). We started coding and it was really fun! It ended up like this (it&amp;#39;s in spanish since I live in Paraguay!):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://torresmateo.github.io/images/baby-steps/sudoku.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Our First GUI!!&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t lie... I don&amp;#39;t like it that much either. But back then it was &lt;em&gt;AWESOME!!&lt;/em&gt; ... Man!! our first GUI!! And it does what it&amp;#39;s supposed to do!! (it didn&amp;#39;t crash
randomly like our first attempts!). We were happy, and run to my family as we finished the program in my house to show how amazing it was. With tears of joy in our eyes
we went to the dining room, laptop in our hands, and showed them! :&amp;#39;D .... The reaction was this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This... is..... hmmmm... niiiice&lt;/em&gt; (read with the least convincing voice you can imagine). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when I first realized it wasn&amp;#39;t easy to get other people excited about this kind of stuff. Sure, it wasn&amp;#39;t Crysis or Uncharted, but it was &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; to make. But
among our classmates, our program was one of the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;OK, now make it &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s important to mention that Fer was always my coding partner in college. So, our next game-related assignment was Batalla Naval ++, an implementation of 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)&quot;&gt;Battleship&lt;/a&gt; with some modifications:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 levels for each player (surface and submarine)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The player has 2 submarines (3 squares) and can move them, sink them or put them in the surface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a submarine is damaged, automatically goes to the surface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Tools:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spy Aircraft&lt;/strong&gt; (2): the player selects a row, a column, or a diagonal, and can see everything in there for a turn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spy Bomb&lt;/strong&gt; (3): the player selects a square, and the spy bomb shows everything in there for three turns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ballistic Missile&lt;/strong&gt; (&amp;infin;): the one from the original game, you select a square, shoot, and if hits, it&amp;#39;s your turn again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the program must fulfill these requirements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The usage of &lt;code&gt;conio.h&lt;/code&gt;, a Windows library for console interfaces ( no GUI this time T_T )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI .... &lt;strong&gt;ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE&lt;/strong&gt; (OMG!! As a must, our program had to &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt; against a human player! &lt;em&gt;A W E S O M E !!!&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we started playing  the modified version of the game on a piece of paper, thinking about some strategies for the AI. We ended with a nice one, which was pretty clever. 
We started with the airplanes, and then the bombs, and then firing at everything that we found. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the spying layouts, it maximizes the spied area:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;|a|_|_|_|X|X|X|_|_|b|
|_|A|_|_|X|E|X|_|B|_|
|_|_|X|_|X|X|X|X|_|_|
|X|X|X|X|_|_|X|_|_|_|
|X|E|X|_|X|X|_|X|X|X|
|X|X|X|_|X|X|_|X|E|X|
|_|_|_|X|_|_|X|X|X|X|
|_|_|X|_|_|_|_|X|_|_|
|_|X|_|_|_|_|_|_|X|_|
|X|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|X|
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://torresmateo.github.io/images/baby-steps/battleship.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Our First AI!!&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing those programs was incredibly fun!! We were learning a lot about coding, and when our own game got to beat us 9 of every 10 matches, we felt very proud (In 
some cases, if the CPU got the first turn, it would play a perfect game, and beat us at the second turn!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note for geeks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can download Sudoku&amp;#39;s source code from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/torresmateo/TAI1-Sudoku&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and Batalla-Naval from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/torresmateo/Batalla-Naval&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both programs were written in C, and using only &lt;em&gt;ONE FILE&lt;/em&gt; per project (&lt;code&gt;main.c&lt;/code&gt;)... I know, that&amp;#39;s bad. But hey!! We were absolute beginners!!&lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>It&#39;s Alive!</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;At first I didn&amp;#39;t actually think about what to put in here. I mean, it&amp;#39;s been almost 4 years since I started developing web related stuff, 
improving myself in the latest tools and techniques to make better, faster, stronger blogs, apps, and little systems to (hopefully) improve
someone&amp;#39;s life by making their everyday work a little easier. All that hand by hand going through my undergraduate courses in Computer 
Science. But let&amp;#39;s take you a little deeper into some of my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;About Myself&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always loved videogames, ever since my dad bought Atari 2600 for me and my brothers, we &amp;quot;wasted away&amp;quot; entire days smashing that red 
button, pushing harder that joystick as if it would make Pitfall Harry run faster or make Pac-Man reach the super-power fruit sooner. Games 
taught me a LOT of things, and taught me better than most of my school teachers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discovered I loved learning, and videogames were the perfect way to make me learn. In school all I could see were meaningless numbers and 
random drawings with the sole objective of turning me and my classmates into some kind of strange zombie-like mindless monster, and thus bore 
me to death. But back home numbers and letters weren&amp;#39;t random, they were Megaman&amp;#39;s life-points, every 100 coins in Mario means a life and it 
was USEFUL to make arithmetic stuff just to play better, it was just fun to learn that way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, after deciding all I wanted to do in my life was to play videogames, reality punched me right in the face with two facts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can&amp;#39;t just play, you need to eat too! And in order to eat you need some strange and evil paper called money. (this isn&amp;#39;t actually true everywhere, but it is here in Paraguay, where I live) &lt;em&gt;well, but I want to play all my life anyways :/&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then you need to DO something so you can have the almighty money to buy games and food so you don&amp;#39;t starve and die! &lt;em&gt;fiiiine, I&amp;#39;ll see what I can do u.u&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I started thinking what I could do so I could spend most of my time playing and avoid boring stuff like school, teachers, and becoming a 
mindless zombie. I searched and searched and then came up with the most awesome idea of all time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if... if... I.... start MAKING videogames?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My life was turned upside down, the idea was incredibly GENIUS!! I could almost kiss myself of joy, so I decided to start simple and program 
something doable, like GTA... and poking here and there in the Internet turned out that making awesome games wasn&amp;#39;t THAT easy. I found stuff 
like &amp;quot;level design&amp;quot; &amp;quot;shaders&amp;quot; &amp;quot;programming&amp;quot; &amp;quot;platform&amp;quot; &amp;quot;engine&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Direct3D&amp;quot; &amp;quot;3D-Modeling&amp;quot; &amp;quot;CAD&amp;quot; &amp;quot;AI&amp;quot;... I was overwhelmed, frustrated and back 
to square 1. But this was the thing that could actually make me happy someday!! So I didn&amp;#39;t give up, I started to code and made a LOT of 
mistakes. So I thought about getting into Computer Science so I could code better, faster and someday make awesome games! I started learning, 
and learning and coding and doing math and a lot of stuff and got lost in the Computer Science world. Being able to MAKE stuff with random 
words in notepad made me forget all about my dreams and hopes, I just loved to code!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my code-fever I joined a little company and started making websites. They were a team of two designers, one of them was almost able to 
code and it was super fun working with them. We made a lot of blogs, and even some little web apps, the company started to grow and 
eventually I joined them and even got to own a third of what had been my first job! I was very happy and thought that was the start of my 
future. But somewhere inside me, the flame for making videogames (which I think is the ultimate form of creativity) wasn&amp;#39;t ready to die yet. 
I planned a new course for the company and wanted to make little games. With my friend&amp;#39;s abilities to draw cool stuff and me being capable of 
coding (after almost 6 years since the original &amp;quot;I want to make games&amp;quot; idea) I thought we could actually do some fun games and maybe sell 
them and be able to make a living out of someone else&amp;#39;s smiles and wasted time in silly iPhone games, and maybe after that become the most 
awesome team in the whole universe and conquer the world funded by our own awesomeness!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But life doesn&amp;#39;t always have the same plans as you do, and that start-up went down in what I think was a stupid argument (it wasn&amp;#39;t actually 
an argument, but I don&amp;#39;t know a better word to describe why we went and decided that it was not possible to work together anymore). So, we 
and the two programmers we hired finished the pending tasks and each one went his way. I was sad, and didn&amp;#39;t want to fail like that again. I 
considered the most horrible idea ever, the one thing I hated the most: go and work for some big company in telecom and make tons of money in 
exchange for almost all your time and brain power, and of course, your soul. And there was I, sad about the &amp;quot;break up&amp;quot; with my buddies and 
considering joining the zombie-like brainless army of telecom coders (to be fair, I actually think telecom is awesome and know a lot of 
amazing people making good work in that field, it&amp;#39;s just not my thing so I rant about it here!). But some of my school friends where there (2 
of them were working with me in the company I joined) and wanted to make another start-up with me. It was one of the things you say in those 
school trips when you are almost drunk from the first beer you&amp;#39;ve ever had: &amp;quot;we will work together in the future, and rule the world, and 
there will only be one country called THE AWESOME REPUBLIC and the only rule will be to play videogames all day, get drunk and eat!&amp;quot;. It 
turned out the first part of that idea wasn&amp;#39;t that crazy after all. I decided to give that a try, and found myself relieved about not having 
to go to a scary telecom giant and ugly business, and keeping my soul clean was priceless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started almost where we left with the new team, they already knew some of the business mechanics and things were looking good, there was 
some money coming in, not a lot, but enough to make us feel like we were doing things right. We managed to make some upgrades compared to the 
previous company in the workflow and we didn&amp;#39;t even have an office (we were working from our houses, like some kind of secret coding society, 
plotting against Comic Sans, Microsoft and poorly written HTML). I am still part of that start-up for the moment, but I&amp;#39;ve already told them 
the current project (the biggest I&amp;#39;ve ever worked as a web developer) is the last one for me. I told them about my dream of becoming a game 
developer, and that working in other stuff was nice, but not enough. It was a really difficult decision and it took me months of thinking and 
about 17 drafts stored in my gmail for me to finally send that mail to my friends. I think the hardest thing I&amp;#39;ve learned in life is that you 
just can&amp;#39;t reach your dreams without some kind of sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be lying if I say I&amp;#39;m not scared, but I&amp;#39;m also excited about my next steps. I&amp;#39;ve got tons of stuff to wrap up before working full 
time in becoming a true game developer (the project I mentioned earlier, my undergraduate thesis, and a lot of other stuff...), but I can 
feel now that little flame burning stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now I think this pretty much sums the important stuff about myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;About this blog...ish website&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve decided to make this with some pretty specific objectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always wanted to create something to share with friends and family and everyone looking to read something about games and how much I 
love them &amp;lt;3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its been years now since I&amp;#39;ve told myself &amp;quot;how come you spend almost all of your time coding websites and telling people what to do to get 
more readers and make interesting stuff but do not do some of that yourself?&amp;quot;. The answer was always a mix of &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t have enough time&amp;quot;, 
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not THAT interesting to start a blog&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not trivial work&amp;quot; and other excuses. I think this is finally the time where I can stop 
saying stupid stuff to myself and finally sit and write some.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will help me keep a record of my &amp;quot;path&amp;quot; into game design and development, and give the people that help me or stand in my way to read 
and enjoy (or feel guilty) about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To keep me on track. If you&amp;#39;re reading this, you&amp;#39;ve seen how easily I get distracted by other stuff that seems to be interesting. I think (
and hope) that thinking regularly about my actual dream will somehow help me achieve it. It&amp;#39;s silly, but I won&amp;#39;t lose anything more than a 
few hours a week writing this and maybe some of my keyboard’s painting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said... I will write one entry every two weeks (more or less). I&amp;#39;ll try to keep them simple and easy to read for non-geeks and non-
programmers and give at least a hint of what&amp;#39;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
